## CSS (Processors)

* by [@tomhodgins](https://github.com/tomhodgins)
 
CSSplus is a family of CSS reprocessing plugins that give you more power when writing CSS. It's called “CSSplus” because it's CSS plus JavaScript, the method most of these plugins use to add power to CSS is by having JavaScript dynamically update CSS variables with information about the browser and elements.

## HTML-Processing / Text Splitting

### Splitting 
* https://github.com/shshaw/Splitting
* https://splitting.js.org
* by [@shshaw](https://github.com/shshaw)

Splitting is a JavaScript microlibrary designed to split (section off) an element in a variety of ways, such as words, characters, child nodes, and more!

Most Splitting methods utilize a series of <span>s populated with CSS variables and data attributes unlocking transitions and animations that were previously not feasible with CSS.

## Scrolling

### BasicScroll 
* https://github.com/electerious/basicScroll
* https://basicscroll.electerious.com
* by [@electerious](https://github.com/electerious)

Standalone parallax scrolling for mobile and desktop with CSS variables.

basicScroll allows you to change CSS variables depending on the scroll position. Use the variables directly in your CSS to animate whatever you want. Highly inspired by skrollr and Reactive Animations with CSS Variables.

### ScrollOut 
* https://github.com/scroll-out/scroll-out
* https://scroll-out.github.io
* by [@notoriousb1t](https://github.com/notoriousb1t)

Install ScrollOut and decorate elements with the data-scroll attribute. As elements become visible, data-scroll will be set to in and when elements are scrolled out they will be set with out. Add your own CSS or JS to make a big impression when things come into view. That's it!

Use the `cssProps` to animate based on scroll position and to do parallax.

## SVG

### Lengthy 
* https://github.com/shshaw/lengthy-svg
* by [@shshaw](https://github.com/shshaw)

Lengthy is a JavaScript microlibrary (1.2kb min, 0.7kb gzipped) to get the length of SVG shapes. The length will automatically be added to the element as a CSS Var to make it easy to do CSS animations of SVG stroke-dashoffset for the wonderful line drawing SVG technique and other interesting animations.
